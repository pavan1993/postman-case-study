Auth Modes
----------
This pipeline emits two Postman collections so teams can choose the right auth path. The **JWT Mock** collection uses the built-in mock server flow: a pre-request script fetches a demo token from `{{base_url}}/auth/token`, caches it in the environment, and attaches `Authorization: Bearer ...` for every call. The **OAuth2 Ready** collection keeps the same requests but swaps in OAuth variables (`{{oauth_token_url}}`, `{{oauth_client_id}}`, `{{oauth_scopes}}`, etc.) plus a placeholder token request under “00 - OAuth2 Setup”. OAuth2 is configured through those variables and structure, but it still requires real IdP endpoints before the token call will succeed. Use JWT Mock for internal demos; switch to OAuth2 Ready once partner-facing IdP details are available.
